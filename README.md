## üè• Overview
CliMB is an AI-enabled partner designed to empower clinician scientists to create predictive models from real-world clinical data, all within a single conversation. With its no-code, natural language interface, CliMB guides you through the entire data science pipeline, from data exploration and engineering to model building and interpretation. The intuitive interface combines an interactive chat with a dashboard that displays project progress, data transformations, and visualizations, making it easy to follow along. Leveraging state-of-the-art methods in AutoML, data-centric AI, and interpretability tools, CliMB offers a streamlined solution for developing robust, clinically relevant predictive models.
