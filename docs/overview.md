## üè• Overview
CliMB is an AI-enabled partner designed to empower clinician scientists to create predictive models from real-world clinical data, all within a single conversation. With its no-code, natural language interface, CliMB guides you through the entire data science pipeline, from data exploration and engineering to model building and interpretation. The intuitive interface combines an interactive chat with a dashboard that displays project progress, data transformations, and visualizations, making it easy to follow along. Leveraging state-of-the-art methods in AutoML, data-centric AI, and interpretability tools, CliMB offers a streamlined solution for developing robust, clinically relevant predictive models.

Our vision is for CliMB to integrate seamlessly into the clinician's workflow, supporting the complete cycle of clinical predictive modeling, and ultimately democratizing machine learning and AI utilization in healthcare.



## üîè Data Privacy

```{admonition} Warning
:class: attention

It is crucial to understand the data privacy and confidentiality implications of using CliMB. Please ensure to read and understand the [Data Privacy documentation section](dataprivacy.md) in full prior to installing and using the system.
```


When using CliMB with real-world clinical data, you as the clinician scientist act as the data steward, and are responsible for ensuring that the use of the data complies with all the relevant laws and regulations, as well as ethical considerations. CliMB aims to provide a secure and privacy-preserving environment for data exploration and model building, while balancing this with leveraging the capabilities of the most advanced large language models (LLMs).

We provide a detailed section in the documentation, which summarizes the data privacy fundamentals of CliMB and should allow you to make an informed decision about using the system with your data. It is essential that you read and understand this prior to using CliMB, please find the link below:

:class: tip

The location of the **repo directory** is explained in the [üìà Install the CliMB package](installation.md#install-the-climb-package) section of the documentation. Don't forget to run `cd climb` to change to the repo directory.
```


To launch CliMB UI, run the command:
```bash
streamlit run entry/st/app.py
```

This will show the output like:
