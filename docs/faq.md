# ‚ùì FAQ

* **Q:** I have a clinical dataset with some patient data. Can I use this data with CliMB?
    * **A:** This depends on the nature and requirements of your data. Reading the [üîè Data Privacy](dataprivacy.md)
    section of this documentation should allow you to make an informed decision on this.

* **Q:** My dataset has so-and-so many variables and so-and-so many records (e.g. patients). Will a dataset of this size work with CliMB?
    * **A:** This depends on your hardware configuration and the details of your dataset(note: for minimal hardware requirements, please refer to the [üì¶ Installation](installation.md#system-requirements)).
        * If your dataset has more than a few 10s of features, the data exploration step may produce too much output, and use up the LLM context window. We recommend using datasets with no more than ~50 features. 
        * A larger number of records (rows of data) will lead to a longer execution time of various tools, especially the predictive modelling step (AutoPrognosis). For a modern workstation with a GPU, please use the following rough guide for time estimate: *5 minutes per 1,000 records* for the AutoPrognosis (longest) step.
