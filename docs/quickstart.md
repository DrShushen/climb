The **Engine parameters** section allows you to configure certain settings of the "engine", such as the specific LLM model (when applicable).
Hover over the <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-question"></i> icon next to each setting to see a tooltip with more information.

Once you select **Start new session**, you will be taken to the main **‚öïÔ∏è CliMB** session screen.
